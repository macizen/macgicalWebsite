            Misrecognition of a Black Art Form in Post-Slavery Capitalist United States
            <br>
            May 12, 2023
            <p class="essay">“Jazz” is a word that has been used throughout the history of the United States to describe a music with constantly changing performative practices and aesthetic qualities originating from the African diaspora in America. This paper will seek to describe how the traditional music of African Americans has been commodified and how the European societal standards of the colonizers of the Americas have been imposed on the music and culture surrounding it. A hierarchical standpoint has been established of European musical tradition being of higher value than African musical tradition. This standpoint has been perpetuated in American society through music education and popular music, among other things, and in turn has caused an unfounded emphasis on the superiority of European standards in the music of the United States. This hierarchy was put in place in part as a result of the United States’ history of slavery and capitalism. These structures will be examined in relation to the formation of “jazz” music in the United States, along with accounts of specific European and African musical traditions, to deeply understand the socio-political atmospheres that exist around each.</p>
            <p class="essay">In the modern day, as a result of colonialism and slavery among other factors, there is no music coming from the European tradition that is not actively being  influenced by other cultures, only reproductions and interpretations of music of the past. For this reason, to examine music that is “purely” of European origin, one must look far back into the history of Europe. As there is an incredibly large and diverse history of music in the entirety of Europe going back hundreds of years, this paper will specifically discuss the music of troubadours in Western Europe during the High Middle Ages (~1000-1350 CE). The two main musical outputs of Europe during this time were the Gregorian chant, which had fundamental ties to Christianity, mostly being performed in churches by catholic monks, and troubadour music, which was secular. Troubadour songs were transcribed, consisting of poetry and prose, meaning that in order to be a Troubadour, one had to be literate, which the vast majority of the population at this time wasn’t. As this music existed during a time of feudalism in Europe, all aspects of it are connected to a culture of social hierarchy. The majority of troubadours were of noble status, some being of high nobility while many others were knights. Members of the lower social classes were able to perform these Troubadour works, but they themselves were not Troubadours, “The songs of the troubadours and trouvères, by contrast, testified to the growing sophistication of Europe’s secular élite; though often performed by itinerant joglars, they were composed by literate aristocrats” (Fletcher 2001, 419). Music may have played an important role in the lives of many Western Europeans during this time, but it was not accessible to many others and was rooted in a culture of social hierarchy and oppression.</p>
            <p class="essay">The African culture that will be discussed in this section is chosen from a very significant region in Africa, where many people were taken as slaves, with a musical tradition that is as old as it is complex. The BaAka are a group of hunter-gatherers that inhabit the Congo Basin in central Africa. Because they inhabit the rainforest, the BaAka have historically been mostly isolated from outside cultures, other than engaging in trade with various small villages around the border of the rainforest. However, they were not immune to the influence of the colonization of Africa and the transatlantic slave trade. Although most of the slaves taken from the region were not BaAka, Ngandu farmers who fled slave-traders caused large-scale relocation in the area, disrupting the living environments of the BaAka. Additional relocation was caused during multiple periods of exploitative labor imposed on Africans of this region for rubber and ivory. Despite this, the BaAka have sustained a rich tradition of music being inseparable from their daily life. Aka music is characterized by group performances, with overlapping rhythmic and melodic parts being performed primarily by the voice, clapping, and beating objects with sticks, additionally there are other types of instruments that utilize resonating objects with the mouth and striking strings to produce tones. Individually, Aka people sing songs into the forest as they travel from place to place, and many group expeditions are accompanied by a collaborative song performance. Song is also ritualistic practice in the culture, being performed at specific times like the return from a successful hunt, as a celebration and to give thanks to the forest. It can clearly be seen that music in this culture is integral to living and that there is no member of the community that is not actively participating in musical activities, whether it be active in performance or passively experiencing the music that is constantly unfolding. Not only that, but the music is deeply complex, yet intuitively understood by all members of the community.</p>
            <p class="essay">From the onset of colonial America, the primary objective seemed to be to amass the largest amount of material wealth possible. In an article on the early economy of the United States, Robert E. Mutch writes, “Self-sufficiency is found to be untenable on two grounds: first, that colonial farmers were not ‘content with a subsistence way of life’ and ‘felt free to pursue wealth with an avidity dangerously close to avarice’, second, that farmers did in fact produce surpluses for a ‘market’ even if that market was found only in the village store” (1980, 849). Even on the smallest, local level, American farmers had the disposition to self-aggrandize over merely being self-sufficient. This obsession with economic growth became deeply important to American culture, and to fuel this desire, European colonizers of the Americas brought African slaves to expand their capital wealth. From the inhumane conditions of the slave ships on the journey to the New World to the vicious scrutinization of the slave’s body and mind at the auction, the slave undergoes complete objectification. The slave therefore becomes a commodity, because “... to commodify is to recognize someone or something as a product that can be bought or sold. For slaves this process entails being stripped of all human signifiers, and being likened to a marketable product” (Walton 2012, 2). The black slaves have been stripped of their humanity, and from this point on there is a deeply ingrained hierarchy in American society of white domination over blacks. Because these people have become slaves to be sold on the market as commodities, they are assigned an exchange-value. This has many implications, including that “not only did whites enhance their economic status in the buying and selling of slaves, but they also elevated their social status by being able to determine the worth and value of blacks” (Ibid, 18). Even after the abolition of slavery, it was still the belief of many white Americans that it was up to them to determine the worth and value of blacks. </p>
            <p class="essay">Oftentimes the black slaves that were taken to the same places in North America were from vastly culturally different groups in Africa. This severance from their homeland, their introduction to an unfamiliar and unwelcoming environment, and the fact that many of the slaves that were held together spoke different languages, they underwent a severe process of natal alienation. In the physical sense, it is clear how natal alienation has taken place. The African slave has been separated from the land where their ancestors lived, where their culture is built, so when they are brought to America, not only are they forcibly integrated into a culture where they are slaves, but they are also made to forget their historical memory. Now in America, the African is not defined by their historical and cultural background, but by their relationship to the structure in which they are only a commodity. The most powerful common ground among the African slaves, and one of the strongest powers in allowing them to congregate and rise against the system that oppresses them, was music. As mentioned earlier, music and dance is an integral part to many African cultures, a common ground for communication. African American music originated out of this natal alienation, out of the desire to create a community where everyone could communicate and recognize one another’s experience. After the emancipation from slavery, this music continued to develop, appropriating the language and instruments of the European-descendant whites into “black” music, that integrated African rhythms and melodies, among other cultural musical practices, such as “call and response”. However, even after the abolition of slavery, black Americans were still in a vastly inferior social standing than white Americans. As a result of the racial hierarchy, and the ingrained belief that whites had some sort of right to the valuation of blacks, it was not long before this new artistic tradition would be misrecognized and commodified by whites, for the purpose of consumption by a white audience.</p>
            <p class="essay">One of the earliest and most shocking examples of a misrecognition and commodification of black American culture is American minstrel shows. The purpose of consuming minstrel shows for many white Americans was merely for entertainment, but the consequences and implications of the shows were vast. A common aspect of minstrel shows was black characters being performed by white actors in blackface. The representation of black characters in each show were severely demeaning, portraying them as having the same level of intelligence as a small child. Aside from the comedic aspect, many white Americans expressed interest in seeing “authentic” black music through these shows. Of course there was no authentic black music being performed at these shows, because what these white Americans really wanted was to experience something they perceived as exciting or “exotic”. The view of music originating from black Americans as exciting, exotic, scandalous, etc., was something that was easily marketable to a white audience. However in doing this, the music that should have been communal in nature, begins to shift towards the European standard, separating the performer from the audience, separating music from life, by commodifying music and making it an indulgence. “Jazz” was a term that started to pop up in the 1910s, meaning something that was exciting, first documented being used to describe music in Chicago newspapers in 1915. At this time, white consumers were still not necessarily interested in seeing black musicians perform, so practically all commercially available “black” music was performed by white musicians in the minstrel show style. The first recorded “jazz” music was released by the “Original Dixieland Jass Band” in 1917, a band made up of white musicians, taking advantage of and profiting from the white consumer’s desire for what they ignorantly believed black music was. Now it’s clear that even in the first instances, jazz was never a word that had anything to do with music. It was merely an advertising strategy to draw in white consumers. It was a word for the capitalist institution to profit off of cultural advancements made by the black communities in New Orleans, Kansas City, Chicago, and New York among others. Because of the massive influence capitalism has, and the endless misrecognition of black culture in the United States, the word “jazz”, that was merely a tool for advertisement, became irrevocably linked to the music.</p>
            <p class="essay">In the 1920s, black musicians had begun to see commercial success, being allowed to perform and record music, having representation of both whites and blacks in the audience. During this time there was also a growing sentiment among the black community in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance, stated by James Weldon Johnson in his preface to The Book of American Negro Poetry, that “The world does not know that a people is great until that people produces great literature and art” (1921). Likely influenced by this sentiment, in the 1940s, a new form of instrumental black American music, sometimes referred to as “bebop” came into popularity. This music was different from the blues, gospel and spiritual music that had come before it, as it heavily integrated European influences into the music, with an emphasis on European instruments, harmonies, and song forms. This music was initially intended as a way of communication between musicians, not necessarily to seek commercial success. However, as music education, and jazz education in particular, became institutionalized in the United States, this music became further integrated into European social traditions through academia. As Fanon says in Black Skin, White Mask, “From one day to the next, the Blacks have had to deal with two systems of reference. Their metaphysics, or less pretentiously their customs and the agencies to which they refer, were abolished because they were in contradiction with a new civilization that imposed its own” (1952, 78). Because of the black’s “being for other” in the United States, the cultural practices of white America have been imposed on the music, it no longer is solely seen from their own perspective.</p>
            <p class="essay">Through the lens of capitalism and post-colonialism, the question of what the word “jazz” is, where it came from, and how it was used to misrecognize a black art form, becomes demystified. In knowing the historical context, one can separate the word from the music and begin to reimagine the history of the music, separate from a word that has held it back. As there is no way to change the history of the music, the most important thing to do is to be aware of it. In being aware of the hierarchy and both the positive and negative influences each musical culture has had on one another, the tradition of American music can continue forward in a more socially conscious way.</p>
